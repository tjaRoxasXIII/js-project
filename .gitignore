#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/back-end/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/back-end/db/*.sqlite3
/back-end/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/back-end/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/back-end/log/*
/back-end/tmp/*
/back-end/!/log/.keep
/back-end/!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/back-end/tmp/pids/*
/back-end/!/tmp/pids/
/back-end/!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/back-end//storage/*
/back-end/!/storage/.keep
